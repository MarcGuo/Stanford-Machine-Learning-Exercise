# Stanford-Machine-Learning-Exercise
Just starting to learn the standford machine learning courses. I implement every exercise in Octave 4.0.3 and I will update this repository for each week. :)

# Added Exercise Solutions:
* 1. Linear Regression
* 2. Logistic Regression
* 3. Neural Networks: Representation
* 4. Neural Networks: Learning
* 5. Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance
* 6. Support Vector Machines
